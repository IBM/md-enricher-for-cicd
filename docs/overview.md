# Overview

Spend more time writing markdown, with better quality, and less time on content delivery management.Â 

## What is it?
The Markdown Enricher is a pre-processing script that brings continuous integration and continuous delivery capabilities to markdown. Manage one set of source files, run Markdown Enricher on those files, and get customized sets of output to use wherever you need them.

## Why would writers want to use the Markdown Enricher?
The [Markdown Enricher](https://github.com/IBM/md-enricher-for-cicd)'s best quality is that it helps writers get similar content to multiple places with some differences between them. Here are some other benefits.

* Single-sourced markdown content authoring and delivery
* Adaptable from simple to complex use cases
* No more copying and pasting from one branch to another when must branches diverge and must stay diverged
* No Git CLI knowledge required
* No merge conflicts between downstream branches
* In editor feature flag control
* In editor content delivery control
* Single-sourced, customized, shared content between branches or repositories
* Set up automatic merges of the output to Github, auto-generated pull requests in Github, or set up your own tools to push the output to
* Custom content re-use (word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, section, or topic)
* Quicker overall delivery times by minimizing errors and repetitive tasks
* Pick up where another writer left off by using tags as a kind of progress indicators
* No impact to downstream automation such as HTML processors
* Quick one-time setup
* Detailed logs and optional Slack posts to troubleshoot issues
* Local transformation for testing or for pushing the output files to a content management system that is not Github



## Potential use cases

- Staging versus production content
- Internal versus external content
- Web versus PDF content
- Cloud versus on-prem content
- Docs for multiple tools that share some common features
- Metadata differences
- Link structure differences
- Reuse across files
