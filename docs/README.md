Welcome to the Markdown Enricher! 

Markdown is a great authoring language for both readibility and simpicity, but if you've used markdown for awhile, you know that it's not perfect. The larger your content set is, the harder it is to maintain. Enter the [Markdown Enricher](https://github.com/IBM/md-enricher-for-cicd)!

The Markdown Enricher is a pre-processing tool that brings a few of the best features of more complex authoring methods to markdown and other text-based files. Plus, the Markdown Enricher includes other continuous integration and continous delivery capabilities as well.
