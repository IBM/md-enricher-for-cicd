# Logs

* **Travis console logs**: You can review abbreviated log information in the Travis console. 
* **Travis log files**: You can review detailed information in the log files. Travis has a limit to how much content can be displayed in the console, so detailed information outputs to log files. For the upstream source repositories, you can review detailed log information in the `BRANCH_NAME-logs` branch.
