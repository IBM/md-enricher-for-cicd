# Markdown Enricher for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

The Markdown Enricher allows writers to single-source content delivery from one branch to multiple branches in the same or different Github repositories. Scale up your markdown capabilities to include things like tags and snippet reuse.

Spend more time writing, with better quality, and less time on content delivery management.
